🔐Webste Hosting:
The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, a reliable platform for serving static websites. The hosting procedure involved the following steps:
 -The website files, including index.html and associated CSS files, were committed and pushed to the root directory of a GitHub repository.
 -Within the repository’s Settings, under the Pages section, the source was configured to use the main branch with the root directory.
 -Upon saving the configuration, GitHub Pages generated a public URL, making the website accessible online.
 -Subsequent updates to the repository are automatically reflected on the live site following each push.
