            <h3>Project 1: Machine Learning Model for Predicting study method and duration</h3>
            <!-- Description of project 1 -->
            <p>In this project, I'm still developing several machine learning models with diffrent algorithms to predict study methods and duration based on student interest data i.e what subjct they want to study ,time of the day, focus level, mood e.t.c</p>
            <p>I'm using Python and libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow to build and evaluate the models.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Project 2: Data Manipulation and Analysis</h3>
            <!-- Description of project 2 -->
            <p>This project involves gaining data manipulation skills on different datasets provided in Datawars for learners.I have done a number of projects in the platform.</p>
        </article>  
        <!-- Project 3 details -->
        <article>
            <h3>Project 3: Web Application for Student learning resources in Tech Innovation Club </h3>
            <!-- Description of project 3 -->
            <p>This project involves developing a web application to provide students with access to learning resources and materials. The application will include features such as resource sharing, discussion forums, and event management.</p>
            <p>I'm yet to begin working on the project, but I plan to use flutter web for the front-end development, and Python with Flask or Django for the back-end.</p>
